## Accessibility

From the very beginning of my career, I’ve worked on projects where accessibility wasn’t an after-thought, but an absolute must. I’ve developed complex user interface components fully compliant with WCAG standards, and ensured thorough manual and contract-based testing.

More recently, in my role leading Design System teams, I’ve acted as an internal advocate and consultant for accessibility.

## Design Systems

In recent years, my focus has been on revamping, planning, building, and leading design systems. I’ve taken underperforming systems with low adoption and transformed them into essential parts of the product development process. I’ve also initiated new systems with high standards for accessibility and quality.

Design systems are like _products within products_, empowering internal designers and engineers to scale features faster. I’ve led design system teams at both startups and large-scale companies like **Typeform** and **New Relic**.

## Platform and developer experience

Serving other engineers within an organization is one of the most complex, yet rewarding, aspects of my work.

I’ve contributed to core product and platform teams, handling roadmaps, planning, implementation, and documentation of tools for fellow developers.

## Digital experiences and tech leading

Earlier in my career, I worked with agencies on challenging projects alongside talented designers, motion designers, and creative developers.

We focused heavily on animation and pixel-perfect implementations, delivering sites for clients like Pixar, Facebook, Doritos, and Oreo.

In fact, several projects where I acted as the technical lead received industry awards!

## Community

Beyond my day job, I enjoy writing about emerging technologies and side projects I find exciting. I’ve had the opportunity to contribute to publications like CSS-Tricks and Smashing Magazine. You can find most of my content in the [writing](/writing) section of this site.

My passion for well-documented features and clear communication also led to my role as the Documentation Lead for [webpack](//github.com/webpack/webpack), a high-profile open-source project.

I’ve also had the pleasure of speaking at conferences, giving keynotes, hosting workshops, and even acting as a master of ceremonies at meetups. Though I’ve paused for now, you can check out my past talks in the [speaking](/speaking) section.

Currently, I’m focused on being the best ambassador I can for JSHeroes, where I help with content, agenda planning, and communication for the event.
