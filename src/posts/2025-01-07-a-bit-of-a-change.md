title: A bit of a change
excerpt: I generally don't do "new job" posts, so this might be the first one. The main reason is, after more than a decade in front-end development positions, I am going to switch to another thing.
---


It's not a radical change. I am not starting a new career as a music producer, a barista or an interior designer (for now), I am still going to be very much around tech and web communities.


As of today, I am a **documentation engineer**. I can list a thousand reasons why this is scary for me, the main one being that after a long time the things that defined whether I am doing a good or a bad job are now different.


There are equal chances I will like this, or not, but I am up for the journey.


## Wait, this actually makes sense


In recent years I worked mainly on platform teams and design system projects. I became really good at it. I love it when my users are other developers.


I ended up as the lead of most of those design systems I worked on, and one of the things I took to heart was working in the open and documenting our tools, despite how much managers and leadership didn't value it.


I didn't care about the extra effort. What is not documented will be misused, or not used at all. That is my mantra.


Looking back at it, this feels like a natural move.


## Yes, this makes a lot of sense


After my first year of being a "professional" web developer, with "professional" meaning I was paid a salary, I immediately started a blog.


The goal wasn't to publish constantly, but to put out pieces about what I learned during my first years of development. Some of which turned into days and nights of research, because I care about what I publish, even if nobody reads.


Then, I wrote on [webpack's blog](//medium.com/webpack/brief-introduction-to-scope-hoisting-in-webpack-8435084c171f), which led to my first [CSS-Tricks](//css-tricks.com/introduction-webpack-entry-output-loaders-plugins/) article, and later a piece on [Smashing Magazine](//www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/10/asynchronous-tasks-modern-javascript/), crossing something from my bucket list. You guessed it, my bucket list is nerdy and uninteresting.


Along with all these, I started speaking at conferences, presenting at meetups, giving workshops, and suddenly I felt leaning naturally to "devrel" territory.


I tried a lot of times to move my career in that direction, but I only failed. I failed to move internally in the companies I was at the moment, and failed at several interviews. In some, I was really close.


## Then, I stopped


After the pandemic, developer relations departments shrunk or just disappeared from most companies. In the meantime, I kept accumulating bad job experiences.


This included toxic working environments, terrible stakeholders and leadership, and basically no career path opportunities.


It affected me so much I just stopped writing, speaking, or doing anything at all.


## Then, I was back


I took some time off after a round of layoffs which luckily included me.


During this sabbatical, I tried to spark some new excitement by building from scratch my personal site. I even bought a new domain, slashing the fairly good search positioning my site had, but who cares.


I wrote [a](1) [bunch](2) [of](3) [articles](4) in a short span of time. I was [back at it](/2024/11/back-at-it/), or sort of.


By this time I was also looking for a job, and serendipitously on a careers page I saw a "Senior Documentation Engineer" position, and told myself maybe now was the right time to do something a bit different.


{% blockquote 'I always wanted to use the word "serendipitously" and now I am scared I misspelled it. If I did, please ignore it.' %}


So, now my main job will be writing, coding proof of concepts, education and overall doing anything to make developer's life easier, which it's actually what I loved the most while working in tech.


## Wrap-up


In the end, it's not such a huge detour, and I can always go back to product engineering whenever I feel like it.


The truth is I have no idea what will happen next, but it's one of those moments where uncertainty is a good feeling to have.
